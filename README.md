# GivDapps
Android Application for GivDapps

7/18/17 - Getting closer to very very basic front-end stuff done.

Things to do:
1. Rename title for each fragment in the navbar
2. Figure out make each fragment have its own exclusive screen so that things don't carry over when switching (have no idea how to do this as of right now)
3. Solve unchecking boxes issue for interest screen
4. Figure out why app crashes when uploading a picture (not sure what's wrong)
5. Add a redirect link to signup page to the left of the "Forgot Password" link in the signin page
6. Begin coding so that you can't progress through screens without entering in something
    6.1. Connect to aws servers
7. Add redirect page back to campaign page on the navbar?
8. Need to know what layout looks like for Favorites, Donations, History, and About fragments
9. Fix formatting for the header on the navbar; picture is a bit cutoff
    9.1. Fix name scaling so that a very long name will have small text, etc.



7/3/17 - Initial upload of the project so far. I've included comments in various files about where I need help in, and I need formatting help for pretty much all the screens to make sure the app works on all screen sizes. 

Checklist for files that need help with formatting:
1. interest_screen.xml (and InterestScreen.java, don't know why checklist doesnt change color when unchecked)
2. intro_screen.xml
3. settings_fragment.xml
4. sign_in.xml 

-ignore the causes_scroller.xml
